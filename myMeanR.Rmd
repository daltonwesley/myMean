# The original source code for this module includes errors in the function due to the inability to verify the object. So to fix this issue we implemented assignment 2 into the sum and length to enable the function to verify where the sum and length were coming from to product the mean of 19.25.

# Assigning the data set.
assignment2 <-c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22) 

# Assigning the dataset to the function of myMean.
myMean <- function(assignment2)
+ {return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))}

# Viewing the output of the "myMean" function.
myMean(assignment2)
